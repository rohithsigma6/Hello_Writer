      <p>
        Registering your screenplay is essential to protect your intellectual
        property. Whether you’re an emerging or established screenwriter, script
        registration provides you with proof of authorship, which can be
        critical if someone plagiarizes or steals your work. In India, multiple
        options are available for registering your script, ranging from local
        screenwriters’ guilds to national copyright offices and modern
        blockchain-based services like Screenplay.ink.
